HYPERUPCALLS INSTALLATION

The code is provided as a proof-of-concept and is not too clean or ready for
prime-time. Feel free to contact me (nadav.amit@gmail.com) in case  you
encounter problems in deployment.


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download and build the kernel repository at
https://gitlab.com/anadav/llvm-hcb . Install this kernel in both the host (as
a hypervisor) and the guest.


2. Download and build the modified llvm at https://gitlab.com/anadav/llvm-hcb
. Install llvm in the guest.


3. Enter into the [kernel]/hcb directory in the guest and run "make". Ensure
that the compiler (llc) that is used is the correct one.


4. Run one of the use-cases, which are described in the paper:

  ./register_hypercallback.sh 0 freemem			# Free memory
  ./register_hypercallback.sh 1 ftrace 			# Tracing 
  ./register_hypercallback.sh 2 ipi 			# TLB-shootdown
  ./register_hypercallback.sh 3 protect_exit 	# Protection
  ./register_hypercallback.sh 4 protect_map 	# Protection
